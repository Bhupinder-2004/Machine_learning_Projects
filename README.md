# Machine_learning_Projects
Iâ€™m a passionate and motivated data analyst just starting my professional journey. I have hands-on experience with data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and SQL. I enjoy turning complex datasets into clear insights through storytelling and visuals.
